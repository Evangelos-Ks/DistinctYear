# DistinctYear
Add a positive year between 10 and 2,000,000,000 and find the next distinct year.
Distinct year is a number where all its digits are distict (the same digit is not repeated in the year).
There are two modes.
  1st Mode:
          The user can choose a year between 10 and 2,000,000,000 and will see the input and distinct year output in the console.
  2nd Mode: 
          The user can choose the range of the random examples that they want.
          The user can choose the range of the years (between 10 and 2,000,000,000) that the programme will generate.
          The user can choose the number of the repetitions (How many times the algorithm will run the examples. This gives greater accuracy in the execution time because we can  see the average result).
         
After the inputs the user will see in the console the generate time of the examples in milliseconds and the execution time in milliseconds.
Also if the user wants they could see the results otherwise they can skip and continue to the menu.
